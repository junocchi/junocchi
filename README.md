### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br/>
As a former HR and Chief of Staff professional, I have always looked for innovative technology ðŸ’» ðŸ˜ƒ to boost productivity and elevate employees' experience. For 7+ years I worked closely with senior management to develop and implement policies, create and maintain a strong organizational culture, attract and retain talented employees, and ensure that the company remained compliant with relevant laws and regulations.

Taking part in internal Digital Commerce and Platform training inspired me to improve my tech skills, so I joined Codebar, a charity that runs free regular programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech. I had such a positive experience coding that ended up doing a full-stack Software Engineering bootcamp. 

I am now a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) ðŸŽ“ graduate looking to start a tech career.
