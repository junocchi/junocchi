### About me

<div style="text-align: justify">  
👩🏻‍💻 I am a curious and enthusiastic full-stack software engineer with a diverse background in People Ops, Animation and HR. I absolutely love helping people from underrepresented groups embark on their tech journey through Codebar, and I'm equally passionate about fostering strong relationships.  I believe that collaboration, communication, and respect form the bedrock of any successful project.
