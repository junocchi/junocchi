### About me

<div style="text-align: justify">  
As a former HR and Chief of Staff professional, I have always looked for innovative technology 💻 to boost productivity and elevate employees' experience. For 7+ years I worked closely with senior management to develop and implement policies, create and maintain a strong organizational culture, attract and retain talented employees, and ensure that the company remained compliant with relevant laws and regulations.
<br/>

Taking part in internal Digital Commerce and Platform training inspired me to improve my tech skills, so I joined Codebar, a charity that runs free regular programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech. I had such a positive experience coding that ended up doing a full-stack Software Engineering bootcamp. 
<br/>

I am now a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) 🎓 graduate looking to start a tech career. See below for my [CV](https://github.com/junocchi/CV), and for highlights of my professional skills from peers and managers, please check my [LinkedIn Recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-nocchi-b4a882222/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0).
